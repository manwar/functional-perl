## Why so many licenses?

The Perl 5 licensing is to make it as simple as possible for people to
decide to use, or contribute to, the project. The Artistic License 2
is what the main Perl 6 implementation components have chosen; the
idea to offer it under that license as well is that porting to / using
with Perl 6 becomes as easy as possible. The MIT licenses is offered
so that the code can be used in different environments as well (like
perhaps a contributor would like to port it, or pieces, to a different
programming language.)

You could license your contributions in any one of those licenses, but
we would appreciate if you could provide them under the same full set
of licenses. If you've got objections or questions about the
licensing, please don't hesitate to [ask](//contact.md).
