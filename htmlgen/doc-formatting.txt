The *.md files support standard Markdown format plus the following
additions:

 - files are expected to carry a header similar to

    "(Check the [Foo website](http://foo.org/) for
    properly formatted versions of these documents.)

    ---
    "

   which is stripped from the file

 - local urls starting with // are resolved to the path where the file
    with the given filename resides. Example:

     [a thing](//some_thing.md)

   is being resolved to something like

     <a href="../bar/some_thing.xhtml">a thing</a>

 - wiki style links like:

    [[some_thing]]

   or

    [[some_thing|a thing]]

   are supported, converting to

     <a href="../bar/some_thing.xhtml">some thing</a>

   or

     <a href="../bar/some_thing.xhtml">a thing</a>

   respectively.
