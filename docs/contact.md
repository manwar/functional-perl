# Contact

The project is currently led by [Christian
Jaeger](http://leafpair.com/contact). I'm also on the `#london.pm` and
`#functional-perl` IRC channels on irc.perl.org as "pflanze".

Please play with the examples and try to write some of your own, read
the docs and tell us what's badly explained, and if you've got
something that might be useful to add to the examples directory, it
would be cool if you offer it. If the test suite fails or you found a
bug, please tell us on the [[mailing_list]], or if you prefer submit
an issue on Github. Documentation improvements are very welcome, as
are general hints and ideas where to take the project or simply
whether you liked it or what you liked and what you didn't. If you'd
like something to be different, now is the best time to tell.

(Also, please point out errors in the use of the english language. All
normal pages on the website are part of the functional-perl
repository; you could also use the 'history' and 'edit' links at the
top.)


See [[mailing_list]] for the list and IRC details. Christian can be
contacted privately [here](http://leafpair.com/contact), too.
