There are many function and module names that have doubtful names. If
you've got some comments on some names, like how the same or similar
functions are named in other languages or ideas on how they could be
named for more consistency, please [tell](//mailing_list.md).

This list of doubtful names is not exhaustive. Also see [[TODO#Names]].

- `array_to_hash_group_by`
- `compose_1side`
- `pxml_map_elements_exhaustively`
- should `stream_iota` be renamed or have different arguments? Compare
  with APL etc.
- `the_object_method`
