## Mailing list

Send user and development questions and bug reports to the public
mailing list at
[functional-perl-list@functional-perl.org](mailto:functional-perl-list@functional-perl.org). A
subscription is not needed to post. Messages that are considered by
the spam filter to look somewhat spammy are moderated.

To subscribe to the list, send an (empty) email to
[functional-perl-list-subscribe@functional-perl.org](mailto:functional-perl-list-subscribe@functional-perl.org). To
unsubscribe, do the same to the address
[functional-perl-list-unsubscribe@functional-perl.org](mailto:functional-perl-list-unsubscribe@functional-perl.org)
instead.

Gmail often first puts mails from this server to its spam folder (in
spite of this server using the same IP for many years, is on no
blacklists, uses DKIM and SPF and takes care never to send or bounce a
spam). Please check your spam folder and teach Gmail that those mails
are not spam. Hopefully this will improve deliverability for everyone
over time. If it doesn't then I'll take the next steps.
