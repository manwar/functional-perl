## Some examples showing the possibilities using `functional-perl`

* `fibs` and `primes` show translations of Haskell programs.

* `gen-csv` and `csv2xml` show how to stream number series into and
  from CSV files and into XML.

* `diff2html` hows how to generate (X)HTML.

* `skip` shows how to implement a sliding window (look-ahead) as a
  pure function (that can be easily tested) and then uses it for IO
