- clean up licensing (some files currently are MIT license even though
  COPYING claims Perl licensing)

- more `intro/`, more `examples/`

- more tests:

  - +-systematic stream leak testing

[- additionally add old-style FP modules from chj-perllib?]

- xopen_read etc. are throwing exceptions; there are no non-throwing
  variants currently. What interface is preferred for handling errors:
  maybe_ variants that return undef (then assume the error is in $! ?),
  give exceptions types so as to catch them selectively, something
  else?

- decide whether to offer methods to shorten names like stream_*
  (I'm inclined against it)

- ditch Chj::IO::* for something else? Or invest some more effort into
  it, e.g. add constructor taking a glob, `set_encoding` method, etc.
