* Handle tag and attribute names safely? For example:

        PXML::Element->new("<>", {"/"=>1}, [])

  will currently serialize to something like <<> /="1"></<>>

* use `HTML::Element`, as base class? Of course that won't work for
  general XML. LibXML for the latter? Well.. Perhaps parametrizable? 

* how are the rules with regards to URL escaping? No escaping, right?
  So should actually be fine? Check in detail, tests.
