* Handle tag and attribute names safely? For example:

        PXML::Element->new("<>", {"/"=>1}, [])

  will currently serialize to something like <<> /="1"></<>>

* use `HTML::Element`, as base class? Of course that won't work for
  general XML. LibXML for the latter? Well.. Perhaps parametrizable?
